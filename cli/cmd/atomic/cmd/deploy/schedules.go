// schedules.go — the Driftfile's `atomic.functions[].cron` field, carried into
// the deploy artifact.
//
// # Why this goes on the artifact and not through the trigger API
//
// There are two ways to register a schedule with a slice, and only one of them
// is metered. `drift atomic trigger register schedule` posts to the api's
// `/ops/trigger/register`, which proxies straight through to the slice — the
// operator never sees it, so `enforceScheduleLimit` never runs. The deploy
// artifact's `Triggers` field goes through the operator, which counts the new
// schedules, checks them against the slice's envelope, and only then registers.
//
// Scheduled jobs are priced (tier.CentsPerScheduledJob). A schedule the
// envelope never sees is a schedule nobody is billed for, so the metered path
// is the only correct one — which is why the Driftfile field is wired here
// rather than as a post-deploy reconcile pass.
//
// # Why a package-level registry
//
// The element deploy functions are called from `drift file apply` (which
// has read the Driftfile) and from `drift atomic deploy` (which has not). Only
// the first can supply schedules, and threading a manifest through three deploy
// signatures to carry one optional map would put a Driftfile concept into the
// single-function path that has no Driftfile. Same shape as the existing
// `atomicForce` flag, and for the same reason.
