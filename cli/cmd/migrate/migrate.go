// Package migrate provides `drift migrate` — assisted, read-only migration
// tooling for bringing workloads onto Drift from another cloud. The first
// (and currently only) provider is Azure.
//
// The posture is hacker-first and trust-first: Drift never holds the
// customer's cloud credentials and never receives their data. Every command
// runs locally, shells out to the provider's own CLI (`az`) with the
// operator's own login, prints exactly what it does, and only ever reads.
